## Description

This is a personal portfolio page for myself. This was created from scratch, and gave me plenty of opportunities to work through problems. The biggest issue that I encountered in the project was trying to make a flexbox, and I am still working on figuring that skill out.

This project was very rewarding for me because I saw that I was able to build something from the ground up. I am also getting better at Googling, and have found some cool things to add to my code that way.

## Usage

This is a basic portfolio website, and I hope to improve it as I increase my coding skills. For now, I was happy to be able to include cool bits of code like the following:
    @font-face {
    font-family: 'Train-One';
    src: url('TrainOne-Regular.ttf');
    }
